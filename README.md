**Simple Proxy** is a lightweight and easy-to-use proxy server built with Ruby, Sinatra, and HTTParty. It's designed to forward requests to specified target URLs, making it a versatile tool for developers working with APIs and web services.

## Features

- Supports GET, POST, and PUT HTTP methods.
- Supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) with `Sinatra::CrossOrigin`.
- Transfers headers and parameters to the target URL.
- Provides mechanisms for starting and stopping the server.

## Installation

To install Simple Proxy, you can add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_proxy'
```
and then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

or simply install it from the command line:

```bash
gem install simple_proxy
```

## Usage

To use Simple Proxy, you can require it in your application:

```ruby
require 'simple_proxy'
```

#### Starting the Server
To start the server:

```ruby
SimpleProxy.run!
```

#### Stopping the Server
To stop the server:

```ruby
SimpleProxy.quit!
```

#### CLI
You can also start or stop the server from the command line:

```bash
simple_proxy start
```

```bash
simple_proxy stop
```

#### Proxying Requests
To proxy requests, you can use the '/proxy' endpoint:

```ruby
get '/proxy' do
  SimpleProxy.proxy(params, request)
end
```

#### Server Info
* Server runs on port 4567 by default.
* Server binds to '0.0.0.0'

#### Example
* Run the server:

  ```bash
  simple_proxy start
  ```
* If you want to solve for CORS for an endpoint say, `https://example.com/api/v1/users/token`
* You can simply make a request as following:

  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:4567/proxy?url=https://example.com/api/v1/users/token
  ```
* This will return the response from the target URL with CORS headers set.

#### Making Proxy Requests
Once the server is running, you can make proxy requests to the following endpoints:

* GET /proxy?url=target_url
* POST /proxy?url=target_url
* PUT /proxy?url=target_url
* HEAD /proxy?url=target_url
* DELETE /proxy?url=target_url

Replace target_url with the URL you want to proxy the request to.
